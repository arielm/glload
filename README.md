The OpenGL Loading Library (GL Load) is the Unofficial OpenGL SDK library for initializing OpenGL's functions. Because of the nature of how OpenGL is implemented, it is necessary to fetch function pointers from OpenGL implementations, rather than simply statically linking to a library. The GL Load library exists to automate this process and make it simple.
